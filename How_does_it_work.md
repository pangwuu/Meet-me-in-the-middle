# How Do We Find the Perfect Meeting Spot?
1. **Start with Two Locations**: We begin with two locations that you and your friend want to meet from.
2. **Convert to Coordinates**: We translate these locations into coordinates on a map to find the straight line between them.
3. **Divide the Path**: We break down the straight line between both points into several potential meeting spots.
4. **Calculate Travel Times**: We then calculate the actual travel times from both starting points to each potential meeting spot. This accounts for different modes of transportation—whether one person is driving and the other is taking public transport, for example.
5. **Find the True Middle**: We look for the spot where the travel times from both locations are closest to equal. This is our best estimate of a fair "middle point" for both parties.
6. **Discover Nearby Meeting Places**: Around this middle point, we search for nearby places within a small radius where you could meet—like cafes, parks, or restaurants. If there aren't enough options within a 100-meter radius, we expand our search to 200 meters, 400 meters, and so on until we find a good selection.
7. **Personalize the Options**: Finally, based on your preferences, we filter the results to show only the types of places you'd like to meet—whether that's a cozy cafe, a quiet park, or something else entirely.

By following these steps, we ensure you find the most convenient and enjoyable meeting spot, no matter where you are coming from!
